# PenTestEngagementProject
Students will use the skills that they have learned in the Offensive Security unit to attack a fictional organization and determine its vulnerabilities. On **Day 1**, students will attempt to exploit vulnerabilities on the organization's web application. On **Day 2**, students will exploit the organization's Linux servers, and on **Day 3**, they'll exploit the organization's Windows servers. The project is structured as a Capture the Flag (CTF) style competition, so that each vulnerability that students exploit correlates with a "flag," and flags are worth various point amounts depending on the difficulty level of the exploit.

## Module Objectives

**Day 1**: Students will be provided a fictional organization's web application that has a variety of vulnerabilities. Students will be tasked with finding flags as they exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Day 2**: Students will continue to exploit the fictional organization, but will focus on the organization's Linux servers and vulnerabilities related to Linux operating systems. Students will continue finding flags during their exploitation.

**Day 3**: Students will continue to exploit the fictional organization, but will focus on the organization's Windows servers and vulnerabilities related to Windows operating systems. Students will continue finding flags during their exploitation.

## Lab Environment
For the majority of this week's demonstrations and activities, the class will use an Azure Lab that contains each day's activities.

## Module Checklist
Before beginning to prep this week's project, be sure you have the following accessible within your lab.  Please notify the curriculum team as soon as possible if any of the following is not available.
- Kali
- Win10
- WINDC01

On Day 1, it is very important that students follow the exact steps of setting up their web application. Specifically, students must pull the most current docker container before bringing it up. The instructions to enable the web application are listed in three steps in their guide.

## Project Deliverables
This project includes the following deliverables:

- **Penetration Testing Summary Report**: The report provides a comprehensive overview of the penetration testing activities conducted during the project. It includes detailed findings, vulnerability descriptions, risk ratings, and mitigation suggestions. Screenshots illustrating the identified vulnerabilities are also included.
